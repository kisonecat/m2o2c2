  Basis vectors span the space without redundancy.
\end{abstract}

  \begin{definition}
 	A vector space is called \textbf{finite dimensional} if it has a finite list of spanning vectors.  A space which is not finite dimensional is called \textit{infinite dimensional}.
 \end{definition}
 
 	Show that the space $P$ of all polynomials in one variable $x$ is infinite dimensional.

\begin{free-response}
	 Let $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n$ be a finite list of  vectors.  
	Since this list of polynomials is finite they must be bounded in degree, i.e.  the degree of $p_i$ must be less than some $k$ for each $i$.  But a linear combination
	of polynomials of degree at most $k$ is also of degree at most $k$.  So the polynomial $x^{k+1} \not\in  \textrm{Span}(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n)$. Thus no finite list of 
	polynomials spans all of $P$.  So $P$ is infinite dimensional.
\end{free-response}

 \begin{definition}
 	Let $V$ be a vector space. An ordered list of vectors $(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$ where all the $v_i \in V$ is called \textit{linearly independent} if
 	$a_1v_1+a_2v_2 + \cdots +a_nv_n = b_1v_1 + b_2v_2 + \cdots + b_nv_n$ implies that $a_1  = b_1, a_2 = b_2, \ldots,a_n=b_n$.  In other words,
 	every vector in the span of $(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the $v_i$ in only one way.  
 	If the set of vectors is not linearly independent it is called \textit{linearly dependent}.
 \end{definition}
 
%\begin{question}
% 	Is BLAH linearly independent?
%\end{question}
 
 	Show that the following alternative definition for linear independence is equivalent to our definition:
 	
 	\begin{definition}
 		Let $V$ be a vector space. An ordered list of vectors $(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$ where all the $v_i \in V$ is called \textit{linearly independent} if
 	$a_1v_1+a_2v_2 + \cdots +a_nv_n = \vec{0}$ implies that $a_i = 0 $ for all $i=1,2,3,\ldots,n$.
 	\end{definition}
 	
 
 \begin{free-response}
	Let us say that our original definition is of  being linearly independent in the first sense, while this second definition is being linearly independent 
	in the second sense.  If a list of vectors $(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$ is linearly independent in the first sense, then if $a_1v_1+a_2v_2 + \cdots +a_nv_n = \vec{0}$ we have
	$a_1v_1+a_2v_2 + \cdots +a_nv_n = 0v_1+0v_2+ \cdots +0v_n$, so by the definition of linear independence in the first sense, we have $a_1=a_2= \cdots =a_n=0$.
	
	On the other hand, if $(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$ are linearly independent in the second sense, then if $a_1v_1+a_2v_2 + \cdots +a_nv_n = b_1v_1 + b_2v_2 + \cdots + b_nv_n$ we have
	$(a_1-b_1)v_1+(a_2-b_2)v_2+\cdots+(a_n-b_n)v_n = \vec{0}$, so $a_i-b_i=0$ for each $i$.  Thus $a_i=b_i$ for each $i$, proving that the list was linearly independent 
	in the first sense.
 \end{free-response}
 
  	Often this definition is easier to check, although it does not capture the ``meaning'' of linear independence as well as the first definition.

 
 	Prove that any ordered list of vectors containing the zero vector is linearly dependent. 
	\begin{free-response}
		We can see immediately from the second definition that since $1\vec{0} = \vec{0}$, but $1\neq 0$, that the list cannot be linearly independent
	\end{free-response}
 
 	Prove that an ordered list of length $2$ (i.e. $(v_1,v_2)$) is linearly dependent if and only if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.
	\begin{free-response}
		For $v_1$ and $v_2$ to be linearly independent there must be two scalars $a,b \in V$ with $av_1+bv_2=0$ with at least one of $a$ or $b$ nonzero.
		Let us assume (without loss of generality) that $a \neq 0$.  Then $av_1=-bv_2$, so $v_1=\frac{-b}{a}v_2$.  Thus one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.

 \begin{theorem}
 	If $(\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\vec{v_3}, \ldots, \vec{v_n})$ is linearly dependent in $V$ and $\vec{v_1} \neq 0$, then one of the vectors $v_j$ is in the 
 	span of $\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\ldots,\vec{v_{j-1}}$
 \end{theorem}
 
Prove this theorem.

\begin{free-response}
 	Since $(\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\vec{v_3}, \ldots, \vec{v_n})$ is linearly dependent, by definition there are scalars $a_i \in \R$ with 
 	$a_1\vec{v_1}+a_2\vec{v_2}+ \cdots +a_n\vec{v_n} = 0$, and not all of the $a_j =0$.  Let $j$ be the largest element of ${2,3,\ldots,n}$ so that $a_j$ is not equal to $0$.
 	Then we have 
 	$v_j = -\frac{a_1}{a_j}\vec{v_1}-\frac{a_2}{a_j}\vec{v_2} -\frac{a_3}{a_j}\vec{v_3} - \cdots -\frac{a_{j-1}}{a_{j-1}}\vec{v_{j-1}}$.
 	So $v_j$ is in the span of $\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\ldots,\vec{v_{j-1}}$.
 \end{free-response}
 
 
 	If $2$ vectors $\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2}$ span $V$, is it possible that the three vectors $\vec{w_1},\vec{w_2},\vec{w_3}$ are linearly independent?
 	
 	\begin{warning}
 		This is harder to prove than you might think!
 	\end{warning}
\begin{free-response}
	No!
	
	Assume to the contrary that $\vec{w_1},\vec{w_2},\vec{w_3}$ are linearly independent.
	
	Since the list $(v_1,v_2)$ spans $V$, the list $(w_1,v_1,v_2)$ is linearly independent.  Thus by the previous theorem, either $v_1$ is in the span of $w_1$,
	or $v_2$ is in the span of $(w_1,v_1)$.  In either case we get that $(w_1,v)$ spans $V$, where $v$ is either $v_1$ or $v_2$.
	
	Now apply the same trick:  $(w_2,w_1,v)$ must span $V$.  So by the previous theorem, either $w_1$ is in the span of $w_2$ or $v$ is in the span of $w_2,w_1$.  
	$w_2$ cannot be in the span of $w_1$ because the $w$'s are linearly independent.  So $v$ is in the span of $w_2,w_1$.  So $(w_2,w_1)$ spans $V$.  But then
	$w_3$ is in the span of $(w_2,w_1)$, contradicting the fact that it is linearly independent from those two vectors.  We have arrived at our contradiction.
	
	Therefore, $w_1,w_2,w_3$ cannot be linearly independent.
\end{free-response}

This problem generalizes:

 \begin{theorem}
 	The length of a linearly independent list of spanning vectors is less than the length of any spanning list of vectors.
	\end{theorem}
Prove this theorem
 \begin{free-response}
 	We will follow the same procedure that we did above.  Assume $(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$ is a list of vectors which spans $V$, and $(w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_m)$ is a linearly
 	independent list of vectors.  We must show that $m<n$.
 	
 	$(w_1,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$ is linearly dependent since $w_1$ is in the span of the $v_i$.  
 	By the theorem above, we can remove on of the $v_i$ and still have a spanning list of length $n$.
 	
 	Repeating this, we can always add one $w$ vector to the beginning of the list, while deleting a $v$ vector from the end of the list.  This maintains a list of length 
 	$n$ which spans all of $V$.  We know that it must be a $v$ which gets deleted, because the $w$s are all linearly independent. 
 	 If $m>n$, then at the $n^{th]$ stage of this process we obtain that $(w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n)$ spans all of $V$, which contradicts the fact that $w_{n+1}$ is supposed 
 	 to be linearly independent from the rest of the $w$.
 \end{free-response}
 
 \begin{definition}
 	An ordered list of vectors $\mathcal{B} = (\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\vec{v_3},\ldots,\vec{v_n})$ is called a \textit{basis} of the vector space $V$ if 
 	$\mathcal{B}$ is both spans $V$ and is linearly independent.  
 \end{definition}
 
 %Show that $1$, $x-1$, $(x-1)^2$ is a basis for the space of polynomials of degree at most $2$.
 %\begin{free-response}
 %	We already showed that the
 %\end{free-response}
 
 
 	Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space.  Show that $V$ has a basis.
\begin{free-response}
	Let $(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$ be a spanning list of vectors (which exists and is finite since $V$ is finite dimensional).  If this list is linearly dependent we can 
	go through the following process:
	For each $i$ if $v_i \in Span(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{i-1})$, delete $v_i$ from the list.  Note that this also covers the $1st$ case:  if $v_1=0$ delete it from the list.
	
	At the end of this process, we have a list of vectors which span $V$, and also no vector is the span of all the previos vectors.  By the theorem above, the list is linearly 
	independent.  So this new list is a basis for $V$.
\end{free-response}

 
 	Note: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space.  Then  every basis of $V$ has the same length.  In other words, if
 	$\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2}, \ldots, \vec{v_n}$ is a basis and	$\vec{w_1},\vec{w_2}, \ldots, \vec{w_m}$ is a basis, then $n=m$.  This follows because we have already proven
 	that $n\leq m$ and $m\leq n$
  
  \begin{definition}
  	We say that a finite dimensional vector space has dimension $n$ if it has a basis of length $n$.
  \end{definition}
  
  	Let $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n,p_{n+1}$ be polynomials in the space $P_n$of all polynomials of degree at most $n$.  Assume $p_i(3) = 0$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,n$.  Is it possible that
  	$p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n,p_{n+1}$ are all linearly independent?  Why or why not?
\begin{free-response}
	No.  If $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n,p_{n+1}$ were all linearly independent then they would form a basis of $P_n$, since $P_n$ has dimension $n+1$.  
	But every polynomial in the span of the $p_i$ must evaluate to $0$ at $x=3$, while some polynomials in $P_n$ do not evaluate to $0$ at $x=3$,  (for example, the polynomial $x$).
